🛠️ Getting Started
Ready to start your Pico journey? Follow these steps:

Choose Your Pico Board:

Raspberry Pi Pico: The original RP2040-based board for general-purpose projects.
Raspberry Pi Pico W: Adds Wi-Fi for IoT and networked applications.
Other Variants: Compatible with RP2040 or RP2350 MCUs.
You'll need a USB cable and optional components like LEDs, sensors, or a breadboard.


Set Up Your Environment:

Install the Pico SDK for C/C++ or MicroPython for Python-based development.
Use an IDE like Thonny, VS Code, or Arduino IDE.
Follow our Setup Guide (coming soon!) for board-specific instructions.


Run Your First Program:

Clone this repository:git clone https://github.com/fatmanweb3/Rpi_Pico.git


Try the blink_led.py example to make an LED blink on your Pico board.


Explore Projects:

Check the /projects folder for board-specific projects, from basic GPIO to Wi-Fi-enabled IoT apps.




🚀 Example Projects
Here’s a sneak peek at projects you can build with this guide:

LED Blinker: Master GPIO basics by flashing an LED on any Pico board.
Wi-Fi Weather Station (Pico W): Fetch and display weather data online.
Sensor Dashboard: Use sensors to monitor temperature, light, and more.
